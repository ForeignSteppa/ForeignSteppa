- 👋 Hi, I’m @ForeignSteppa
- 👀 I’m interested in Giant Mech Robots, Im Talking About stuff U See In Transformers and Pasific Rim, I beleive its possible to accomplish these great advancements to tech today so i started searching for knowledge on how to build my own.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how create my own jarvis ai assistant, and no i dont have experience doing this stuff i didnt go to school for it, I really just got bitten by the tech bug to be honest, im a total beginner, and yes jarvis from the iron man movies, why u ask? i had to start somewhere and im going to really need a personal assistant to help me run and manage all this tech. I also love Aliens and always wondered if i could ever meet a freindly one someday that would bestow me the vast knowledge of all the universe, a spaceship or some cool Alien Tech, im a grateful guy i would be happy either way 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with anyone who would be so kind on helping me expand my knowledge on everything or anything they can offer,  could be a website u know, some line off code or a tutorial about building robots, anything code, tech, robots, computers, ai, im gratefully ready to learn, im hands on so i learn pretty fast, any type of help on any topic would be greatly appreciated.
